                            She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, 
                            and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time! Dantooine. 
                            They're on Dantooine. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! Hey, Luke! 
                            May the Force be with you. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. <strong> Oh God, my 
                            uncle.</strong> <em> How am I ever gonna explain this?</em> I'm trying not to, kid. Kid, I've 
                            flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never
                            seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no 
                            mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. I care. 
                            So, what do you think of her, Han? Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. Hokey religions 
                            and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. A tremor in the Force. The last 
                            time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.
